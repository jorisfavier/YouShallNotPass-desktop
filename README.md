# YouShallNotPass Desktop

The only secure way to transmit your login/password informations from the YouShallNotPass mobile app to your desktop.

## How It works
Open the app and follow the instructions. You can safely close the window since the app will stay in your tray icon in order to receive any informations sent from the mobile app. If you want to quit the app, click on the tray icon or use the app menu.
This application is a stand-alone so no need to install it.
